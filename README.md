# 🎓 Capstone Project - Business Data Management (BDM)

## 📘 Strengthening Student Performance and Educational Outcomes - YSR Science Academy

Welcome to the dynamic world of **YSR Science Academy’s Academic Optimization Project**! 🚀 This repository contains our capstone project for the Business Data Management (BDM) course at IIT Madras. Our mission: to **enhance student performance, optimize academic resource allocation, and drive data-based educational decisions** through intelligent analytics and visualization tools. 🌟

## 📚 Project Overview

This project focuses on **YSR Science Academy**, a leading tuition institute in Thane that provides academic coaching for students from Class 8 to 12 across Science and Commerce streams, along with JEE and NEET preparation.  

The institute faced challenges such as **inefficient batch scheduling, lack of personalized performance tracking, and underutilized resources**. Through data-driven methodologies, this project aims to transform operations by using **analytics, AI, and dashboards** to improve educational outcomes, reduce inefficiencies, and enhance overall student success. 📈

## 🗂️ Repository Contents

Here’s what you’ll find inside this repository:

- **Code**: Python and Excel-based scripts for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and performance prediction. 🧑‍💻  
- **Data**: Raw and cleaned datasets containing student performance, attendance, and resource allocation records. 📊  
- **Presentation**: PowerPoint slides summarizing our methodology, findings, and actionable recommendations. 📑  

## 🔍 Data Collection and Cleaning

We collected academic data — including attendance logs, internal test results, faculty schedules, and feedback — from YSR Science Academy over the project duration.  

The collected data was meticulously **cleaned and standardized**, ensuring consistency and reliability for deeper analytical exploration. 🧹📚

## 📈 Data Analysis

We leveraged **Excel, Python, and visualization tools** to derive insights from the educational data using the following analyses:

- **Performance Analysis** 📊: Tracking student progress and identifying underperformers.  
- **Attendance & Engagement Analysis** 🧾: Studying how attendance correlates with academic performance.  
- **Batch Utilization Analysis** 🧮: Measuring faculty efficiency and identifying overcrowded or underutilized classes.  
- **Feedback Analysis** 💬: Understanding student and parent satisfaction trends.

### 🔍 Advanced Analytical Techniques

To extract richer insights, advanced analytics were employed:

- **K-Means Clustering** 🎯: Grouping students based on performance and engagement levels to design personalized learning interventions.  
- **Predictive Modeling** 🤖: Using Decision Trees and Logistic Regression to forecast student success probabilities in JEE/NEET and internal exams.  
- **Optimization Algorithms** 📅: Generating balanced schedules to maximize faculty utilization and minimize student-teacher ratio issues.  
- **Interactive Dashboards** 📊: Visualizing performance, attendance, and outcomes in real-time for faculty and parents.  
- **Feedback Loop Analysis** 🔁: Continuously refining models with new data to ensure adaptability.

## 🚀 Results and Recommendations

Our analysis revealed several impactful outcomes:

- **Improved Student Monitoring**: Centralized tracking of academic data enhanced visibility into student progress.  
- **Personalized Learning Plans**: Data-driven segmentation enabled targeted academic interventions for struggling students.  
- **Resource Optimization**: Intelligent scheduling balanced faculty workloads and improved teaching quality.  
- **Early Risk Detection**: Predictive analytics identified at-risk students early, allowing timely intervention.

**Recommendations:**
- 📊 **Implement Predictive Dashboards**: Deploy dynamic dashboards to monitor real-time performance.  
- 🧠 **Adopt AI-Based Interventions**: Use machine learning insights to personalize study plans.  
- 🕒 **Optimize Scheduling**: Use data-driven timetables to reduce class overcrowding and improve faculty efficiency.  
- 💬 **Enhance Stakeholder Communication**: Share progress dashboards with parents for greater transparency.

## 🏁 Conclusion
